# OneNote API error and warning codes 

*__Applies to:__ Consumer notebooks on OneDrive | Enterprise notebooks on Office 365*

This article describes error and warning codes that are returned by the OneNote API whenever a request sent through the API fails.

<a name="responses"></a>
## Error and warning responses
When your request generates an error, the OneNote API stops performing the request and returns an error response as a JSON object. An error response contains the associated error code, a message, and a link to the appropriate section of this article. The following example shows how an error response looks.

```json
{
   "error":{
      "code":"10002",
      "message":"The service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.",
      "@api.url":"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=400805"
   }
}
```
 
When your request generates a warning, the OneNote API performs the request and includes the warning in its response. A response can contain more than one warning, so the API returns warnings as an array of JSON objects. Each warning contains a message and a link to the appropriate section of this article. The following example shows how a warning response looks in the context of a completed request.

```
{
   "@odata.context":"https://www.onenote.com/api/v1.0/$metadata#me/notes/notebooks",
   "api.diagnostics@odata.type":"#Collection(Microsoft.OneNote.Api.Diagnostic)",
   "@api.diagnostics":[
      {
         "message":"Created date/time string 5/5/2014 in 'Presentation' part html did not match any of the allowed formats",
         "url":"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=400816"
      }
   ],
   "value":[
      {
         "isDefault":false,
         "createdBy":null,
         "modifiedTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
         "userRole":"Owner",
         "id":"55C9F7CBFC6AC1!76345",
         "name":"Notebook1",
         "link":null
      },
      {
         "isDefault":true,
         "createdBy":null,
         "modifiedTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
         "userRole":"Owner",
         "id":"55C9F7CBFC6AC1!76428",
         "name":"Notebook2",
         "link":null
      },
      {
         "isDefault":false,
         "createdBy":null,
         "modifiedTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
         "userRole":"Owner",
         "id":"55C9F7CBFC6AC1!77509",
         "name":"Notebook3",
         "link":null
      }
   ]
}
```

A request can also generate both an error and one or more warnings. In that case the OneNote API stops performing the request and returns both the error and the warnings. The following example shows how an error that contains a warning looks.

```
{
   "error":{
      "code":"10002",
      "message":"The service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.",
      "@api.url":"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=400805",
      "api.diagnostics@odata.type":"#Collection(Microsoft.OneNote.Api.Diagnostic)",
      "@api.diagnostics":[
         {
            "message":"Created date/time string 5/5/2014 in 'Presentation' part html did not match any of the allowed formats",
            "url":"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=400816"
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

If you need to work with Microsoft support to resolve any issues, be sure to also log the [X-CorrelationId header](#x-correlationid) and timestamp of the API call.

<a name="C10002"></a>
### 10002
The service is not currently available.

<a name="C10003"></a>
### 10003
The current user's account has exceeded the maximum number of active requests. Your app will have to repeat the request.

<a name="C10004"></a>
### 10004
The service can't create a page in the requested section because that section is protected by a password.

<a name="C10005"></a>
### 10005
The request contains more than the maximum number of image tags in which the **data-render-src** attribute contains a PDF. See [Add images and files](../howto/onenote-images-files.md).

### 10006
The OneNote API was unable to create a page in the specified section because that section is corrupt.

<a name="C10007"></a>
### 10007
The server is too busy to handle the incoming request at this moment. Please try again later.

<a name="C10008"></a>
### 10008
One or more of the document libraries on the user or group's OneDrive contains more than 5000 OneNote items (notebooks, sections, section groups), and cannot be queried using the API. Please make sure that none of the user or group's document libraries contains more than 5000 OneNote items. See the [OneNote Dev blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/onenotedev/2016/09/11/onenote-api-calls-fail-with-a-large-number-of-items-in-a-sharepoint-document-library/) for mitigation steps.

<a name="C10012"></a>
### 10012
Unable to create or update the entity because the library that contains the notebook requires items to be checked out before they can be edited. For more information, see https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Configure-a-site-library-to-require-check-out-of-files-f63fcbdc-1db6-4eb7-a3eb-dd815500c9e7.

  For more information, see [OneNote API throttling and how to avoid it](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/onenotedev/archive/2016/01/13/onenote-api-throttling-and-best-practices.aspx).

<a name="C20168"></a>

<a name="C30001-39999"></a>
## Codes from 30001 to 39999
Something is wrong with the user's account.

<a name="C30101"></a>
### 30101
The user account has exceeded its OneDrive quota. See [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/).

<a name="C30102"></a>
### 30102
Nothing more can be added to the requested section because it has reached its maximum size.

<a name="C30103"></a>
### 30103
Resource consumption is too high for the request. Either the target user account has a large dataset, or the service is receiving a high number of concurrent requests to the same site (for example, the user's personal site or a team site).

<a name="C30104"></a>
### 30104
The user account has been suspended.

<a name="C30105"></a>
### 30105
The user's personal OneDrive for Business site is not provisioned, which is required to access notebooks. The OneNote service will provision the site now. This process may take several minutes.

<a name="C30106"></a>
### 30106
OneDrive for Business is being provisioned for the user.

<a name="C30107"></a>
### 30108
The user's personal OneDrive for Business could not be retrieved. Here are some possible causes.

| Cause | Resolution |
|:------|:------|
| The user's personal site has not been provisioned. | The user should open OneDrive for Business and follow any instructions to provision the site. If this fails, they should contact their Office 365 tenant administrator. |
| The user's personal site is currently being provisioned. | Try the request later. |
| The user does not have a valid OneDrive for Business license. | The user should contact their Office 365 tenant administrator. |
| A network issue prevented the request from being successfully sent. | Try the request later. |


<a name="C40001-49999"></a>
## Codes from 40001 to 49999
The user or application does not have the correct permissions.

<a name="C40001"></a>
### 40001
The request doesn't contain a valid OAuth token. See [OneNote authentication and permissions](../howto/onenote-auth.md).

<a name="C40002"></a>
### 40002
The user doesn't have permission to write to the requested location.

<a name="C40003"></a>
### 40003
The user doesn't have permission to access the requested resource.

<a name="C40004"></a>
### 40004
The OAuth token doesn't have the required scopes to perform the requested action. See [OneNote authentication and permissions](../howto/onenote-auth.md).

<a name="x-correlationid"></a>
## X-CorrelationId header
In addition to standard HTTP response codes, the OneNote API returns headers to the calling app. Included in every response is an **X-CorrelationId** header and a **Date** header, as shown in the following excerpt:

```
X-CorrelationId: d2d6aaf5-3bde-4ee7-ba18-27727bf3cffe
Date: Fri, 06 Mar 2015 15:10:46 GMT
```

The correlation ID is a GUID that ties together the various pieces in the backend servers. Correlation IDs are not sequential, which means you can't use them to establish an order of page creation.
 
Your app can log the correlation ID and date of your API calls. You can use these values if you need to work with Microsoft support to resolve problems in your app or with the API.
